Finn: (knocking on Tree Trunks' door) Hey, Tree Trunks! We're on a quest for pie. 
	Got any baking magic up your sleeves?

Tree Trunks: (welcoming them with a smile) Well, hey there, Finn and Jake! Funny 
	you should mention pie. I'm in the mood to bake, but I need a special ingredient.

Jake: (curious) Special ingredient? What do you need?

Tree Trunks: (thoughtful) An apple, my dears, a juicy, green apple. Bring me the 
	best one you can find, and I'll whip up a pie that'll make your taste buds dance!

Finn: (determined) An apple it is! Adventure time to find the perfect apple, Jake!

The duo embarks on a mini-quest to find the juiciest apple in Ooo. After some 
	exploration and a bit of climbing, they discover a beautiful, ripe apple hanging from a tree.

Jake: (grabbing the apple with his stretchy arm) Look at this beauty! Tree Trunks will love it.

Finn: (smiling) Let's bring it back to her and get ready for the most mathematical pie ever!

Back at Tree Trunks' home, they present the apple to her.

Tree Trunks: (excited) Oh, thank you, dearies! This apple is perfect. I'll make you the best pie you've ever tasted!

Finn: (grinning) Can't wait! Thanks, Tree Trunks. Adventure time for pie!

Tree Trunks: (waving) You're welcome, darlings. The best is yet to come! Ah, I almost 
	forgot, here take this page, I found it in my recipes books and it's of little importance to me.
