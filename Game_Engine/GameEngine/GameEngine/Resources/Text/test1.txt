Finn: (knocking on Tree Trunks' door) Hey, Tree Trunks! We're on a quest for pie. 
	Got any baking magic up your sleeves?

Tree Trunks: (welcoming them with a smile) Well, hey there, Finn and Jake! Funny 
	you should mention pie. I'm in the mood to bake, but I need a special ingredient.

Jake: (curious) Special ingredient? What do you need?

Tree Trunks: (thoughtful) An apple, my dears, a juicy, green apple. Bring me the 
	best one you can find, and I'll whip up a pie that'll make your taste buds dance!

Finn: (determined) An apple it is! Adventure time to find the perfect apple, Jake!
