Finn: Hey there, what's got you all panicked?

Slime Subject: Oh, Finn! It's a mess! The whole kingdom's in chaos because Princess Slime can't find her favorite green ruby from her crown!

Finn: (serious) That's no good. We can't have chaos in the Slime Kingdom. What can I do to help?

Slime Subject: (pleading) You gotta find the princess's favorite ruby! It's gotta be somewhere around here. Please, Finn, the kingdom depends on it!

Finn: (nodding)  I pledge my hero honour that the great hero Billy bestowed on me, I'll track down that ruby and bring back order to the Slime Kingdom!  (Thinking) Maybe I will also find a page of the book here.  Lead the way to where the princess was last!
