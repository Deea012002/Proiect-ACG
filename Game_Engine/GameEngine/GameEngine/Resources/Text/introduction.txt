Finn: Hey, Jake, you up? Wake up man, we need to go.

-----Finn shakes his pocket…

Jake: Huuuuh? ZZZZZ…

Finn: Wake up, bro, I need you.

Jake: Oh no, no, let me sleep just 5 more minutes, mum.

Finn: Jakeeee, I am not your mum. I am your brother, dont you remember me?
      I am a 12 year old boy and you are my brother,  the magical dog
      than can shrink and enlarge himself.

-----Finn shakes his pocket again trying to poke Jake that was asleep in there. 

Finn: Wake up!!!

Jake: Ok, ok, I am awake. What is happening??

Finn: I need your help. I need to find all the lost pages of the Enchiridion,
      the book of all heroes to prove Billy that I am worthy of following in
      his footsteps. I just dont remember the controls, help me Jake…

Jake: Look man, its easy. Use W,A,S,D to move, E to interact with objects and
      people and the mouse/(UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to move your head around.

Finn: Thanks bro!
