As Finn  approaches the mountain, they encounter Gunter, the penguin, blocking his path.

Gunter: MEEEEPPP (you cannot pass) !!!
Finn: (knocking lightly) Sorry, little guy, I just need to talk to the Ice King.

Gunter starts crying loudly. Soon, the Ice King rushes in, alarmed. Finn stands before the Ice King, who eyes them with a mixture of annoyance and curiosity. The penguin, Gunter, squawks in the background, seemingly unharmed but watching him with a hint of defiance.

Ice King: What's going on? Why is Gunter crying?

Finn: We caught him guarding the entrance. Now, we need to discuss your spying on Princess Bubblegum.

Ice King: (sighs) Fine, fine. I'll stop! ARRHHSS.!!!!!  I can't stand that penguin's crying; it's annoying!
