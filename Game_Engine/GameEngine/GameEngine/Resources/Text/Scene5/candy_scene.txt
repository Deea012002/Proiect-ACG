Finn: Hey, PB! I've got a quest on my hands, and I could use your brainpower.

Princess Bubblegum: Oh, Finn, didn't see you here. What's the quest? Need some help with something?

Finn: (grinning)  I'm on hunt for the last page of the Enchiridion. Got any leads?

Princess Bubblegum: (curious) The Enchiridion? What's the rush?

Finn: (excited) I wanna meet my biggest hero in Ooo. But I need that last page. Any idea where it could be?

Princess Bubblegum: (thoughtful) Hmmm, the Enchiridion... I don't have the exact location, but I've heard that it might be here, in the Candy Kingdom. Check around, and you might find what you're looking for.

Finn: (thankful) Thanks, PB! 

With Princess Bubblegum's hint, Finn sets off to explore the Candy kingdom in hopes of uncovering the mysterious fifth page of the Enchiridion.

 Finn finally discovers the elusive fifth page of the Enchiridion. As he triumphantly holds it up, Jake appears from his pocket with a big grin.

Finn: (excited) Jake, look! I found the last page! Now we can finally meet Billy!

Jake: (smiling) All done, buddy! Let's go meet Billy and see what epic adventures await us!

Finn and Jake set off, armed with the completed Enchiridion, ready to embark on a journey to meet their biggest hero, Billy, and face whatever challenges lie ahead in the Land of Ooo. Adventure time continues!
