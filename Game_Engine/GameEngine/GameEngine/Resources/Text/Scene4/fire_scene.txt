Finn: Hey, what's going on here? Why the long face?

Fire Subject: Finn, it's bad. The Fire King has gone mad. He's treating his subjects horribly, and we can't take it anymore. Someone needs to stand up to him!

Finn: (determined) I can't let that slide. Where's the Fire King?

Fire Subject: He is around here. But be careful, he's not holding back!

Finn  finds Princess Flame instead, armed and ready.

Princess Flame: So, you're here to challenge my father? Well, I won't go easy on you.

Finn: (raising his sword) Let's do this, Princess. But listen, there's more to this than just a fight. Your father's hurting the kingdom.

After a fierce battle, Finn manages to subdue Princess Flame.

Finn: (catching his breath) Listen, Princess, I know you care about the kingdom. Your father's cruelty is tearing it apart. You need to dethrone your father.  He is a dictactor and controls everyone, even you!

Princess Flame: (hesitant)  I, I .... I  do care. Most of the time, he keeps me encapsulated in a lamp fearing that I will dethrone him someday

Princess Flame, torn between loyalty and concern, contemplates Finn's words, realizing the truth in his advice.

Princess Flame: This have to stops, this time I will bring justice to my people! Thanks Finn!
